# Full-Stack Fitness Tracker

## About the Project
This project is a full stack application that allows user to add information regarding a work-out session. The Front-End is designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript while the back-end componnts include storage of a fitness session as an object into the MongoDB database via API and HTML routes handled by Express.JS
I developed this application during the 8th week of the coding bootcamp experience at Columbia University, NY. Date of publication: 11/18/2020
